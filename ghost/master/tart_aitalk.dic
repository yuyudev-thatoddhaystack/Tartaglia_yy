//nonoverlap means that all possible dialogue candidates will be chosen at least once before any dialogues are repeated. Note that anything within brackets counts as a single dialogue candidate! This causes the probability issues mentioned in the YAYA tips file. I included an example of a dialogue pool here, if you set those up they'll work properly with nonoverlap. Also note, though: if you set up something like different modes, you should give each one it's own function for dialogue! If you have all your dialogues in one big if, nonoverlap won't have any effect.

//-----------Pools-----------

//Example of a pool. You can name pools whatever you like. I always start them with Pool_ so that it's clear what they are. They MUST have : array after the function name, or they won't work. I also recommend putting a comment with what if check activates this pool, so it's easy to remember later.

	//"\0\s[0]This is the third dialogue from the pool!\w8\w8 Putting dialogues in a pool like this means that nonoverlap can affect them properly, so long as nothing else interferes!\e"
	//"\0\s[0]This is the fourth dialogue from the pool!\w8\w8 You could nest another pool inside this pool,\w4 and all the dialogues in there would also display with equal probabilities!\e"
	//"\0\s[0]This is the fifth dialogue from the pool!\w8\w8 Pools can be placed anywhere,\w4 not just RandomTalk!\e"
	//"\0\s[0]Here's a chain!\e:chain=achain"

	"\0\s[0]There's plenty of delicious food to sink your teeth into in this world\w2.\w2.\w2.\w2 and plenty of fights to sink your teeth into as well.\w8 Life is beautiful.\e"
	"\0\s[0]Food is like weaponry.\w8 A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat.\w8 Neither should you.\e"
