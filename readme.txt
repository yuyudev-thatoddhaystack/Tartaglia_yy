Welp. It's been several years. I don't see myself coming back to this guy anytime soon so I am unleashing him on the world in his Ghost Jam State


Original Readme:(04.24.21)

Pain.

Welcome to Tartaglia: Ghost Jam Edition

I had a lot more planned for him but then I was stricken by Plague LARP for three-ish days.

He has a lot of AITalk lines at least.

Enjoy him. Cherish him. This will be a better readme someday.
